<p align="left">

We are a group of experts on the impact of climate change on different ecosystems (agricultural and marine ecosystem mainly) and we approach risk from its multiple component (hazard, exposure, vulnerability and adaptive capacity).   
  
  #### We started developing tools that can be used to process climate models and other climate related datasets

- 🏢 We are currently working with **CORDEX-CORE** climate models.
- 🌍 We support **GEF and GCF** projects.
- 🌱 We develop tools that could better link climate science and policy.  
- 🌱 We develop tools for automatic processing of crop model output simulations, in this case Aquacrop (FAO).
